## About The Project

> This repo is just my remote container for storing diff versions of the Fun Run Registration
> assignment that was assigned to us in the course Application Development.

## Thoughts

I separated the three different versions of the assignment (Assignment 1, Assignment 2, Assignment 3) in three different branches.
The `main` branch on the other hand is the base code for all three assignments, and it utilized ORM to communicate with the database.
This approach made development easy as I just had to configure my DB creds and the ORM framework did the heavylifting for me.
This also means that anyone with access to the repo can just run the `main` branch (given sufficient DB creds) and they could
then work their way through the different branches for three assignments.

## Developer Notes

Free? Only if you're reading this. That means I made the repo public!
